## What is HOTH?
**Hack on the Hill (HOTH)** is a 12-hour **beginner-friendly hackathon** where you **collaborate with others** to build a technology-based project. You don’t need prior hackathon experience to participate — **HOTH is designed to help you explore, experiment, and grow.**

The goal of HOTH is to:
- Meet awesome people
- Build something you’re proud of
- Learn new skills
- Have fun!

## What to Expect
**Workshops:** 
You’ll learn new technical skills directly from fellow students through workshops. 
**Mentorship:** 
Mentors are available throughout the event to help you work through roadblocks.
**Community:** 
Meet new people, collaborate, and participate in social activities.
**Prizes:** 
Awards are given for categories such as:
- Best Overall Hack
- Best Use of AI
- Best Beginner Hack

## Forming a Team and an Idea
### Team Formation
- Already have a team? You’re set!
- No team? Join the **Discord** and reach out to others: [Hack UCLA ACM Discord](https://discord.gg/gwaaFS2fah)

### Forming an Idea
- Look at this year’s **theme and tracks**
- Check the [HOTH Gallery](https://hoth.uclaacm.com/gallery) for past winning projects
- Ask yourself:
  - Is there a product you use that could be better?
  - Is there something you’ve always wanted to build?
  - Is there something you wish existed?
- Keep in mind: your project should be **achievable in 12 hours** and it’s okay to **pivot** during the hackathon!

-- 
## Planning Your Project
- Project outline: Identify the key components and features
- Prioritize features: Determine which features are "must-haves" and implement those first
- Break down tasks: Assign small tasks to each team member

-- 
## Choosing Your Tech Stack 
### Web Development
- **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Flask (Python), Node.js & Express

### Mobile App Development
- **iOS:** Swift
- **Cross-platform:** React Native

### Game Development
- **Engines:** Unity, Unreal Engine
- **Languages:** C#, C++

## Databases & APIs
- **Databases:** MongoDB (Beginner-friendly), Cassandra, Amazon DynamoDB
